# How to Recruit
{: .page-header }

The following information is the general workflow for new recruits/applicants:

1. Applicant fills out application.
2. Application is reviewed by Officers.
3. The sponsoring officer reaches out to the applicant to explain the process.
4. Sponsoring officer determines the next guild activity to bring the member on.
5. After the run members provide feedback in Ventrilo publicly or privately. At least two members must support bringing the applicant into the guild. Any objection to including the applicant will bar recruitment pending officer review.
6. After member reviews have been collected if the applicant is approved they will be invited to the guild with limited privileges.
7. After two weeks if there are no complaints the recruit is promoted to full member.

## What do you do if someone is interested?
Answer any questions they have and direct them to the application form on the website.

## What do you do if someone doesn't want to apply?
Tell them all applicants must apply. It's a deal breaker. No one will be accepted without application.

## If someone has applied and has questions regarding their status what should you say?
Look at their recruit thread and go from there. The top post in the thread will contain their current status.

<h1 id="introduction">Void Legion</h1>
<p>Void is a gaming organization established in 2009. We originally formed in the game Aion (Meslamtaeda/Tiamat) as a group of social adults dedicated to steady progression, end game PvPvE and an emphasis on fun. Our primary goal is to offer the best experience possible to our players.</p>

<p>We have the understanding that we are all adults with real life responsibilities, families and careers and these responsibilities come first!</p>

<h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>
<p>Every successful organization needs a direction and goals in order to progress. Void is no different. Our main goal is to strengthen each and every member of Void for PvE and PvP. That means armor, weapons, quests, campaigns, leveling and anything else we can do to enhance each other's playtime and effectiveness. Unless we work together and strengthen those around us we will not succeed.</p>

<h2 id="mumble">Mumble</h2>
<p>Mumble is required for all members. It is an important tool for us to get to know each other and come together. All activities require Mumble (even if you can only listen), please keep this in mind when you apply. </p>

<h2 id="recruitment">Recruitment Information</h2>
<p>Void recruits members based on their personality, play times and positive feedback from current members.</p>

<p>Applicant requirements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You must be 18 or older.</li>
  <li>You must have Mumble for group/legion activities.</li>
